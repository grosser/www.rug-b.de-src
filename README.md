Source Code for www.rug-b.de
============================

This is the collaborative effort of the RubyUserGroup::Berlin (RUG-B) to create a new public site featuring the group's various activities.

We are using StaticMatic to generate the actual site to be pushed to [Github Pages](http://rug-b.github.com).
